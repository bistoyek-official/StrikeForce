**StrikeForce** is an open-source, simple online game with a 1980s style. Experience exciting shooter gameplay and enjoy battle royale matches, availabe in Windows, Unix-based operating systems and Apple devices.

This project also has a scientific aspect. You can create AI bots and have them compete against each other to see who wins. Additionally, you can use this project to train single and multi agent AI models. This open-source environment for ML and AI development can serve as the basis for many research studies on learning methods.

We organize events focusing on different parts of this game, especially the AI Battle Royale section.
